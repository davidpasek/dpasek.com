                        <p class="p-longer-text">I am a software and infrastructure IT architect and visionary who programmed and sold his first commercial software at the age of 17 in 1991, when the world was not as dependent on IT as it is today. A beautiful example of the maturity of IT in 1992 is the <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/davidpasek/exchange-office-30-stanovisko-sttn-banky-eskoslovensk" target="_blank">certification of the State Bank of Czechoslovakia </a>issued on my application program for the exchange agenda, which was written on a typewriter. Since then, of course, a lot has happened in the field of ICT and Informatics and it was great to be there. During my studies in Informatics at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics and Information Science at the Faculty of Arts of Charles University in Prague, in addition to software programming, I also recognized the power and potential of the Internet and information. During my studies, I worked since 1996 as one of the first technical employees of the first commercial Internet provider in the Czech Republic, Czech On Line (COL). At the time, COL provided Internet services under the <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_On_Line" target="_blank">Video On Line </a>(<strong>VOL</strong>) brand, later <strong>VOLný</strong>. At COL, I worked as a webmaster, system and database administrator and as an architect participated in the development and operation of a fully automated billing and provisioning system. In 2000, Czech On Line was bought by Austria Telecom for approximately CZK 8.5 billion.

                        <p class="p-longer-text">In 1998, I founded <strong>IDC-softwarehouse</strong>, which focused on Internet applications. The most successful publicly known projects include the online ticket reservation system, on which the portals Letuska.cz, Lety.cz and hundreds of similar reservation portals were built not only in the Czech Republic, but also in other Central and Eastern European countries. Online ticket booking was a really big vision and challenge in 2001, which after 20 years (in 2021) may not be so obvious, as it is taken for granted. Online solutions have always been and still are a form of service. This form was formerly called ASP (Application Service Providing) and today it is called SaaS (Software as a Service). However, the principle is still the same. The Online Booking Project (GOL), along with the entire DevOps team, was purchased in 2016 by Travelport GALILEO, the world's leading global distribution system for travel services.

                        <p class="p-longer-text">Since 2006, I have been working on data center technologies specializing in virtualization and the cloud as an individual contractor in the multinational companies <strong>Dell</strong>, <strong>Cisco</strong>, and <strong>VMware</strong>. I have achieved the highest professional certifications in this area (<a href="https://vcdx.vmware.com/" target="_blank">VCDX</a> - VMware Certified Design Expert) and I have often been a leading architect or technical designer on many large projects in the Czech Republic and abroad. You can see few customer references at following links&nbsp;<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/davidpasek/recommendation-letter-pib" target="_blank">PIB</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/davidpasek/recognition-letter-to2" target="_blank">O2</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/davidpasek/recommendation-letter-rferl-radio-free-europeradio-liberty" target="_blank">RFE / RL</a>. In the years 2010 to 2014, I actively participated in the design of large cloud providers in the Czech Republic (<a href="https://www.cloud4com.com/" target="_blank">Cloud4Com</a>, Telefonica O2, etc.)</p>

                        <p class="p-longer-text">In 2010, I was one of co-founders of Czech local enteprise IaaS cloud provider <strong>Cloud4com</strong>. The <a href="https://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-66642920-komarkova-aricoma-koupila-jednoho-z-nejvetsich-poskytovatelu-datovych-center-v-cesku-cloud4com" target="_blank">Cloud4Com startup was purchased in 2019 by the investment company KKCG</a> and incorporated into the Aricoma group, within which it expanded the competencies of the system integrator Autocont. I am still working in very dynamic field of IT infrastructure and while working on infrastructure projects and IaaS clouds, I reaffirmed that IT is the most important technology for any 21st century business today. Despite the importance of reliable infrastructure, real business primarily needs quality, modern and constantly available software applications.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p class="p-longer-text">The demand for modern "cloud-native" software able to run across multiple IaaS clouds and support "infinite" scale was one of the reasons why I launched another software project in 2014, which in the form of service allows anyone to make online reservations for any business, technical or human resources, and related events or services.&nbsp;This system is called <strong>FlexBook</strong> and is operated as a B2B platform, where it is integrated by business partners into their websites and portals. However, FlexBook is not delivered as a mere SaaS (Software as a Service) solution, but everything is provided as direct support for the customer's business and reservations for its resources, events and services. This model is inspired by the Global Distribution Systems (GDS) for booking tickets, hotels and cars from various tour operators. We have promoted the idea of GDS to GRRID (Global Resource and Reservation Information Database). We are building FlexBook as a flexible and easy-to-use booking platform for any bookable resources, events and services, see <a href="https://www.flexbook.info/" target="_blank">FLEXBOOK</a>.</p>

                        <p class="p-longer-text">Since I have been working in the IT community and business for over 25 years, I am often approached by people, acquaintances and friends who have an idea of an IT system and want to bring it to a successful end. There are a lot of thoughts and ideas, but successful implementation is what is important. To successfully implement any idea, it is necessary to discuss the original idea and create a viable and feasible concept. Make such a prototype from such a concept and then implement (pilot) it in small steps and continuously operate and improve it. A friend (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonyhasek/" target="_blank">Tony Hasek)</a> came to me with one such idea in 2017, and based on an IT joke from the 90's that the safest computer is one that is disconnected from the computer network, disconnected from the power grid and locked in a bank in a safe, built the concept on the basis of which the <a href="https://www.goldilock.com/" target="_blank">Goldilock</a> project was created. We'll see how it turns out.</p>
